        he registered a season-best effort of 86.47 metres, becoming one of the few Indian athletes to win a gold medal on their Commonwealth Games debut, 
        also becoming the first Indian to win the javelin throw at the Games.In May 2018, he again broke the national record at the Doha Diamond League with a throw of 87.43 metres.

        In August 2018, Chopra made his debut appearance at the Asian Games representing India, and was also the flag-bearer for the Indian contingent during the 2018 Asian Games Parade of Nations.
        On 27 August, he threw a distance of 88.06 m to win gold in the Men's javelin throw at the 2018 Asian Games and set a new Indian national record, bettering his own previous record.
        It was also India's first gold medal in javelin throw at the Asian Games. Chopra was the only track and field athlete that year to be recommended by the AFI for the country's highest sports award,
        the Khel Ratna, but was awarded the Arjuna Award in September 2018.He was further rewarded by the army with an out-of-turn promotion to subedar in November.

        Having suffered an elbow injury, Chopra underwent surgery in Mumbai on 2 May 2019, the day after the qualifying competitions for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics had begun.
        After a period of recuperation, involving meditation and rehabilitative training at Patiala and the IIS Vijayanagar, Chopra travelled to South Africa in November 2019 for training under German biomechanics expert Klaus Bartoneitz.
        Previously, he had been coached by Gary Calvert,Werner Daniels and Uwe Hohn. After a 16-month hiatus,

        which as a distance of over 85 meters qualified him for the Tokyo Olympiad.

        After South Africa, Chopra travelled to Turkey for training, but was forced to return to India in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Owing to the pandemic and lockdown in India,
        Chopra spent the next year training at the NIS Patiala. In late 2020, the Athletics Federation of India and the Odisha state government aided the national javelin team by arranging a training camp at Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar,
        which Chopra attended from December 2020 through February 2021.
        On 5 March 2021,Chopra again broke his own national record with a new throw of 88.07m, which ranked him third-best internationally.
